### Browse the Go Tour

What to expect:

1. Get a feel for the language syntax.
2. Don't worry if some of it looks odd or complicated right now, you're just browsing.
3. Relate as much of what you see to what you already know through other programming languages. Some concepts will just be syntax difference, others will be new.

### Read Effective Go

What to expect:

1. Now what you've done the tour, Effective Go will give you a foundation for building Go programs
2. You'll learn everything from how Go code is organized to the idiomatic ways of handling errors
3. It's okay to digest this information in bits and pieces--there's a lot there.

### Build something!

If you've done the Go Tour and read part or most of Effectiive Go, you've got enough foundational knowledge to build something. The rest of your comfort with Go will come more easily through practice.

Ideas (in case you don't already have any):

1. Build a Go equivalent to the `wc` shell command.
2. Extend your `wc` CLI tool to support concurrent counting.
3. Build a CLI-based currency converter.
4. Repurpose your currency converter into a REST+JSON service.

### Write Go like a Gopher

Use [Go Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments) to supplement the knowledge you've gained from reading Effective Go and building some tools. It's a collection of common expectations and idioms from Go code and contains a list of common mistakes to avoid.
